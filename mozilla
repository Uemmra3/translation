In furthering the advantages and appeal of the Web as a platform for games and game technologies, Mozilla is publishing its games-focused roadmap. In short, itâ€™s all about high-performance, plugin-free games on the Web. We have made incredible progress over the last few years; to continue this trend, Mozilla has been working with game developers and tool makers to identify additional enhancements that will further empower the community. The following roadmap outlines both the feedback we received and the solutions we are currently pursuing in response to this feedback. This roadmap may be subject to change.

With the unveiling of WebAssembly, browsers have taken another common step towards native levels of performance on the Web. This roadmap outlines the wider view of additional Web platform functionality needed to allow game developers to provide the best possible experiences. Games are often a great catalyst for driving technology forward due to their demanding nature. To maximize the benefit to the Web, care has been taken to ensure that solutions will benefit the widest possible range of applications.

There are two levels to this document. The first is the Roadmap section which contains areas that are currently in development and we have a reasonable level of confidence we can address in the next year. The second is the Under Consideration section which contains topics that are under active investigation.
